        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still 
                firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash. Mix in butter, finely chopped onion and 1/4 cup 
                shredded cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste; set aside.</li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook until tender but still 
                firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash and set aside. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 
                degrees C.)</li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and cook until clear. Add ground beef and cook 
                until well browned. Pour off excess fat, then stir in flour and cook 1 minute. Add 
                ketchup and beef broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Spread the ground beef in an even layer on the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish. Next, 
                spread a layer of mashed carrots. Top with the mashed potato mixture and sprinkle with 
                remaining shredded cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
